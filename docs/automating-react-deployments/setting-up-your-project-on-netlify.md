### **Setting up Your Project on Netlify**
Now we are going to set our React app on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Start by [creating a free account](https://app.netlify.com/signup).

![Signup for Netlify screenshot](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/be5b2a7047fa29090139b9b7e66cc08972e42520/2f8d1/assets/part2/signup-for-netlify.png)

Next, create a new site by hitting the **New site from Git** button.

Pick **GitHub** as your provider.

Then pick your project from the list.

It’ll default the branch to master. We can now deploy our app! Hit **Deploy site**.

![Hit Deploy site screenshot](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f0f19783a61cd167cba566a6566db5c80422e423/21df4/assets/part2/hit-deploy-site.png)

This should be deploying our app. Once it is done, click on the deployment.

And you should see your app in action!

Of course, it is hosted on a Netlify URL. We’ll change that by configuring custom domains next.
